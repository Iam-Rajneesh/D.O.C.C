It is a web application for auto allocating dates of court cases that helps to automate and stream line the process of scheduling court proceedings.
The system can be designed to simplify the allocation of dates by taking into consideration factors such as the availability of the judge, courtroom, and time of filling of chart-sheet or FIR relevant parties involved in the case. Once a case is filed, the application would automatically generate a proposed date for the hearing based on the court's calendar and the priority of the case. The proposed date has to be accepted by both the parties and the regarding procedure has to be followed by them.
