A web application  for generating Date of Court Cases

Problem - "Courts are getting many cases and currently it is becoming challenging to prioritize those cases. A software/algorithm should be developed for prioritizing and allocations of dates to the cases based on the following parameters: - Time of filing of chargesheet - Severity of the crime and sections involved - Last hearing date - Degree of responsibility of the alleged perpetrators System should be free ofÂ impartiality."

Solution - It is a web application for auto allocating dates of court cases that helps to automate and stream line the process of scheduling court proceedings.
The system can be designed to simplify the allocation of dates by taking into consideration factors such as the availability of the judge, courtroom, and time of filling of chart-sheet or FIR relevant parties involved in the case. Once a case is filed, the application would automatically generate a proposed date for the hearing based on the court's calendar and the priority of the case. The proposed date has to be accepted by both the parties and the regarding procedure has to be followed by them.
